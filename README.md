# Power-Plant-Energy-Prediction

## AI Challenge!
The aim of this challenge is to predict the hourly energy output of a cyclic power plant based on given parameters. The dataset consists of 2 csv files:

1.TRAIN.csv

2.TEST.csv

### TRAIN.csv consists of 5 attributes:

AT (Temperature)

V (Exhaust Vacuum)

AP (Ambient Pressure)

RH (Relative Humidity)

PE (Net Hourly Electrical Energy Output) (Target Column)

This data should be used to train the model, no additional data is allowed to be used for the training process.

### TEST.csv consists of the testing data required for prediction and consists of 4 attributes:

AT

V

AP

RH
